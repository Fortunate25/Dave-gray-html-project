Hi, This a project given to us by my favorite YouTube teacher Dave Gray!

Thank you and please check for the codes and as well feel free to correct and criticize as well.


It was actually a TAco shop project but I just had to make use of an NFT project as I didnt have internet connection then to download the files for the Taco project and the NFT projets were saved on my phone then.

Either way, I  feel happy watching these videos as I have learnt a lot. Thanks Dave Gray!!!!!!!!!!
